                            Legal representation, assistance, and advice by qualified counsel are important parts of any legal system. Providing these legal services to marginalized populations is a challenge faced by all societies based on the Rule of Law. These challenges are only magnified for the poor in developing countries.

INARA Legal Aid Service (INALAS) was founded by independent lawyers in February 2009 in the city of Kigali.
